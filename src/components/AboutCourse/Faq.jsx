                            Once you enroll for a Certificate, you’ll have
                            access to all videos, quizzes, and programming
                            assignments (if applicable). Peer review assignments
                            can only be submitted and reviewed once your session
                            has begun. If you choose to explore the course
                            without purchasing, you may not be able to access
                            certain assignments.

                            When you enroll in the course, you get access to all
                            of the courses in the Specialization, and you earn a
                            certificate when you complete the work. Your
                            electronic Certificate will be added to your
                            Accomplishments page - from there, you can print
                            your Certificate or add it to your LinkedIn profile.
                            If you only want to read and view the course
                            content, you can audit the course for free.
